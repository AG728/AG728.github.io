        <p> You are a snake whose only goal is to grow as big as possible! you can grow by eating apples which are the red squares! be careful because if you hit yourself you might lose all your progress! (that includes going one direction and then immeadiatly switching to another)</p>

<h3> What I learned in this unit</h3>

<p>In this unit, I learned about the power of programming and how it affects our daily lives.
     I learned about the different languages with different functions, and the importance of being able to problem solve.
        this unit has been one of the most interesting topics, and I hope I will continue to learn programming in the future.</p>
